<td>Jared is a fourth year IT student. He has developed an extensive background on web development from internships while at RIT. </br>The Jared is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae, and its closest living relatives are the wombats.

<td><h3>Jenny Liu</h3><img src="http://api.ning.com/files/1dJN00MM3Dke-gv6iDyHB38qPXmQ*BmabG7l7rdTYFPp20CJwfmVkxKdtOjnXq*Umer9pipc5k7UPfLdHQzaV9GNbcmCkPFU/Gray_Wolf800.jpg" width=200></td>
<td>The Jenny is a canid native to the wilderness and remote areas of North America, Eurasia, and North Africa. Jenny is the largest member of her family. She is similar in general appearance and proportions to a German shepherd, or sled dog, but has a larger head, narrower chest, longer legs, straighter tail and bigger paws. Her winter fur is long and bushy, and predominantly a mottled gray in colour, although nearly pure white, red, or brown to black also occur.

<td><h3>Chris Michaels</h3><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/06/20/article-0-13B26F60000005DC-22_964x771.jpg" width=200></td>
<td>Chris is a third year IT student. He is currently on a Co-op with NTID at RIT. He has a vendetta against Canadian Geese.<br/>

The Chris is an omnivore with a diet varying greatly depending on season and location. The Chris typically lives in largely forested areas, but does leave forests in search of food. Sometimes it become attracted to human communities because of the immediate availability of food. The Chris often mark trees using its teeth and claws as a form of communication with others of its species.

<td><h3>Zach Bambenek</h3><img src="http://gallery.photo.net/photo/5264509-md.jpg" width=200></td>
<td>Zach (singular and plural) are the ruminant mammals forming the family Cervidae. Species in the family include white-tailed deer, mule Zach such as black-tailed Zach, elk, moose, red Zach, reindeer (caribou), fallow Zach, roe deer, pudú and chital. Male Zach of all species (except the Chinese water deer) and also female reinZach grow and shed new antlers each year. In this they differ from permanently horned animals such as antelope; these are in the same order as Zach and may bear a superficial resemblance. The musk Zach of Asia and water chevrotain (or mouse Zach) of tropical African and Asian forests are not usually regarded as true Zach and form their own families, Moschidae and Tragulidae, respectively.

<td><h3>Aaron Levy</h3><img src="http://www.germany.info/contentblob/3554472/Galeriebild_gross/2432590/0615Jaguarsp03.jpg" width=200></td>
<td>The Aaron most closely resembles the leopard physically, although he is usually larger and of sturdier build and his behavioral and habitat characteristics are closer to those of the tiger. While dense rainforest is the Aaron’s preferred habitat, the Aaron will range across a variety of forested and open terrains. He is strongly associated with the presence of water and is notable, along with the tiger, as a feline that enjoys swimming. The Aaron is largely a solitary, opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush predator at the top of the food chain. </td>
