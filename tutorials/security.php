				<p class="rightside">
				The most important thing to know about security in Unix is how permissions work.<br />
				There are three distinct levels of permissions, User, Group, and Other.<br />
				<strong>User</strong> permissions apply to the owner of the file<br />
				<strong>Group</strong> applies to the members of the same group as the owner<br />
				<strong>Other</strong> applies to everyone else<br />
				</p>
				<p class="rightside">
				Files/Directories in UNIX are given permissions in three-digit numbers
				The first number is the User permission, the second is the group permission, and the third is the Other permission level.
				</p>
				<p class="rightside">
				The types of permissions in UNIX are Read, Write and Execute. Each of these is assigned a number.<br />
				Read = 4<br />
				Write = 2<br />
				Execute = 1<br />
				</p>
				<p class="rightside">
				The sum of that number will yield the permission value for that specific type. 
				e.g. Letâ€™s say you want the owner to have full permissions, Read + Write + Execute (4+2+1) is equal to 7. If you want everyone to have total permissions, then you would set the permissions as 777, although that is not advised.
